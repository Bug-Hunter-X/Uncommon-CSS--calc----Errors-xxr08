To fix the unit compatibility issue, ensure that you are using consistent units within the `calc()` function.  If you need to mix units, perform the necessary conversions before passing them to `calc()`.  To resolve issues within flexbox, ensure that the parent container has a defined width, or use alternative methods to achieve the desired layout.  For instance, consider using flex-grow and flex-shrink properties to handle dynamic widths.
