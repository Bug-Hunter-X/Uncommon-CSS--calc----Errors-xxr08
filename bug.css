The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected results.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a flexbox context might not work as expected if the parent container doesn't have a defined width.  Another issue arises when using `calc()` with units that aren't compatible, such as mixing `px` and `em` without proper unit conversion.
